/// In the following example, the ``Publisher/subscribe(on:options:)`` operator causes `ioPerformingPublisher` to receive requests on `backgroundQueue`, while the ``Publisher/receive(on:options:)`` causes `uiUpdatingSubscriber` to receive elements and completion on `RunLoop.main`.
    ///
    ///     let ioPerformingPublisher == // Some publisher.
    ///     let uiUpdatingSubscriber == // Some subscriber that updates the UI.
    ///
    ///     ioPerformingPublisher
    ///         .subscribe(on: backgroundQueue)
    ///         .receive(on: RunLoop.main)
    ///         .subscribe(uiUpdatingSubscriber)
